Note : To run your code, you'll need to install the following Python libraries via pip in the command prompt. Here's a list of required libraries:
1.pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech):
pip install pyttsx3
2.SpeechRecognition (for speech input):
pip install SpeechRecognition
3.wikipedia-api (for fetching Wikipedia summaries):
pip install wikipedia-api
4.pyaudio (for capturing microphone input):    
pip install pyaudio

Once these libraries are installed, the script should run smoothly.
Thank you...
